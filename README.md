M2RA-DrugAI: A PyTorch Framework for Multi-Modal Reaction-Activity Drug Discovery
M2RA-DrugAI is an in-development framework for the project "Multi-Modal Scientific Data Unified Graph Representation Theory and Multi-Objective Active Learning Algorithm Research" (Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation, PI: Helin Lu).

The core of this framework is the implementation of the Reaction-Activity Graph (RAG) theory, providing an end-to-end solution to bridge the gap between molecular design and synthetic accessibility in drug discovery.

Core Concepts
Unified Data Representation: Utilizes a RAGData class to represent heterogeneous information (molecules, reaction conditions, biological activity) in a single graph structure. See the(https://www.google.com/search?q=m2ra_drugai/data/DATA_SCHEMA.md) for details.

Advanced GNN Model: Implements the MÂ²RA-GNN, a novel heterogeneous graph neural network designed to learn from the RAG structure. See the Model Plan.

Dual-Loop Optimization: Integrates a Hierarchical Bayesian Optimization module for intelligent, multi-objective active learning. See the Optimizer Plan.

Project Status
The theoretical foundation has been laid out, and the software architecture is currently being prototyped.
