"""
Hierarchical Bayesian Optimization (BO) for Dual-Loop Active Learning.

This module implements the core logic for the dual-loop optimization strategy,
which is a key innovation of this project.

Core Logic:
- Outer Loop (Molecule Discovery): Suggests new molecular structures to synthesize,
  balancing predicted activity against synthesis uncertainty.
- Inner Loop (Synthesis Optimization): For a given molecule, suggests optimal
  reaction conditions to maximize the synthesis yield.
- Utilizes the MÂ²RA-GNN model as its surrogate model to get predictions and
  uncertainty estimates.
