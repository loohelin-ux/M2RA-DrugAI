M²RA-GNN (Multi-Modal Reaction-Activity Graph Neural Network) Model Definition.

This module contains the core implementation of the heterogeneous Graph Neural Network
architecture. It is designed to operate on the RAG (Reaction-Activity Graph) data
structure.

Key Features:
- Implements heterogeneous message passing for different relation types (e.g.,
  chemical transformations vs. condition modulations).
- Integrates an Equivariant Graph Attention (EQGAT) layer to process 3D geometric
  information of molecules.
- Ends with multi-task prediction heads for reaction yield and biological activity.
